# libpd-Swift-sample
This is sample for libpd on Swift.  
This source is named "sample", but it's buggy maybe.  
Please be care.  

If you want the sample on Android or Objective-C, I recommend the book "Making Musical Apps" by Peter Brinkmann.

# Getting Started
git clone and set up libpd(recommend use CocoaPods).
```
# cd libpd-Swift-sample/
# pod install
```
double click libpd-Swift-sample.xcworkspace
